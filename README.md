DMS Custom Site Options
-------------------- 
--must use ACF PRO--
--------------------
This plugin creates a site settings panel in your WordPress admin with 2 tabs, Contact Info & Enqueue Scripts. I built this plugin for use on a multisite network running Oxygen.
The contact tab has contact info for the website name, address, phone, email, & social media links.
The enqueue functions include an extra checkbox for front page only.

ACF export is included if you want to disable the include fields.php, and import the options page yourself to edit it.

*The plugin will not activate without ACF Pro activated on your website*
